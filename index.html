  <h1>Sandeep Manjanna</h1>
  <p>
    Dr. Sandeep Manjanna is a founding faculty at Plaksha University. His research is concentrated in applied machine learning and robotics. 
    Earlier, he was a James McDonnell Postdoctoral Fellow at GRASP Labs in Computer and Information Science at University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. 
    His research interests include robotic active sampling, multi-robot coordination, robotic sensor networks, reinforcement learning, and machine learning.
    
    Dr. Manjanna received his MSc and PhD from McGill University, advised by Prof. Gregory Dudek. 
    His doctoral research focuses on designing algorithms for autonomous vehicles to sample, understand, and map challenging environments.

  <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
  <div class="project">
    <h3>Policy Search on Aggregated State Space for Active Sampling</h3>
    <p>
      We present an adaptive sampling technique that generates efficient paths to measure and model a scalar field. Sampling paths are computed to minimize time while maximizing information gain using non‑myopic reinforcement learning.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Heterogeneous Multirobot System for Exploration and Strategic Water Sampling</h3>
    <p>
      A team of autonomous surface vehicles plans and executes water sampling using chlorophyll density as a cue—ideal for water quality monitoring in reservoirs and marine environments.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Data Driven Sampling for Marine Vehicles using Multi‑scale Trajectories</h3>
    <p>
      We propose efficient sparse coverage strategies that balance energy, time, and sensing cost, generating multi‑scale paths to build variable‑resolution spatial maps.
